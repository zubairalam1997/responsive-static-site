            The usage of cloud services has become closely associated with
            common cloud offerings, such as software as a service (SaaS),
            platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service
            (IaaS).Â  SaaS is a software distribution model in which applications
            are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to
            customers over a network, typically the internet. Examples include G
            Suite -- formerly Google Apps -- Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce
            and Workday. PaaS refers to the delivery of operating systems and
            associated services over the internet without downloads or
            installation.
